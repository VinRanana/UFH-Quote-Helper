# UFH Quote Helper



### App that generates information needed for underfloor heating quotations



Quoting customers for UFH can be time-consuming. Lots of formulas to calculate, and stock codes to refer to, and each project has its own unique parameters to take into consideration. My aim for this app is to take all the unique info about a project, and then display the stock codes and quantities to be used for quoting purposes. Once this has been achieved, some additional features would include:

- Generating other useful info such as pricing
- Quoting for multiple rooms
- Expanding the product range
- Adding upsell options
- Improving the UI and making the styling slick
- Extending the app into a customer app for ordering items



### MVP

The MVP will take all the unique info about a project, and then display the stock codes and quantities, as well as some other useful info. I will first only allow a small range of UFH products. The stock codes should copy to the clipboard when clicked. The input parameters should be easy and quick to enter, with a UI that's simple to understand.
